NAME
    Encode::UTF8Mac - "utf-8-mac" encoding, a variant utf-8 used by Mac OSX

SYNOPSIS
      use Encode;
      use Encode::UTF8Mac;
  
      my ($filename) = <*.txt>;

      $filename = Encode::decode('utf-8', $filename);
      # => "poke\x{0301}mon.txt" (NFD é)

      $filename = Encode::decode('utf-8-mac', $filename);
      # => "pok\x{00E9}mon.txt" (NFC é)

DESCRIPTION
    Encode::UTF8Mac provides a encoding called "utf-8-mac" for Mac OSX.

    On Mac OSX, utf-8 encoding is used and it is NFD (Normalization Form
    canonical Decomposition). If you want to get NFC (Normalization Form
    canonical Composition) character you need to use Unicode::Normalize's
    "NFC()".

    However, Mac OSX filesystem does not follow the exact specification.
    Specifically, the following ranges are not decomposed.

      U+2000-U+2FFF
      U+F900-U+FAFF
      U+2F800-U+2FAFF

    <http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#qa/qa2001/qa1173.html>

    In iconv (bundled Mac), this encoding can be using as "utf-8-mac". This
    module adds "utf-8-mac" encoding for Encode, it encode/decode text with
    that rule in mind. This will help when you decode file name on Mac.

    See more specific example:
    <http://perl-users.jp/articles/advent-calendar/2010/english/24>

ENCODING
    utf-8-mac

        *   Encode::decode('utf-8-mac', $octets)

            Decode as utf-8, and normalize form C except special range using
            Unicode::Normalize.

        *   Encode::encode('utf-8-mac', $string)

            Normalize form D except special range using Unicode::Normalize,
            and encode as utf-8.

            OSX file system change NFD automatically. So actually, this is
            not necessary.

COOKBOOK
      use Encode;
      use Encode::Locale;
  
      # change locale_fs "utf-8" to "utf-8-mac"
      if ($^O eq 'darwin') {
          require Encode::UTF8Mac;
          $Encode::Locale::ENCODING_LOCALE_FS = 'utf-8-mac';
      }
  
      $filename = Encode::decode('locale_fs', $filename);

    If you are using Encode::Locale, you may want to do this.

SEE ALSO
    Encode::Locale - provides usefull "magic" encoding.

    Unicode::Normalize::Mac - contains "utf-8-mac" logic.
